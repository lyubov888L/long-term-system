"Finance" Investments - to invest and receive dividends. To make this process calm and profitable. We invested finances at the entrance - at the exit the capital tripled or, perhaps, increased tenfold. 
Experience the emotions of a millionth transaction.
Sector "Love"
warm romantic relationship. Give flowers and jewelry, and be loved, spend as much time together as possible. Travel together, play sports.

  Sector "Family"
 family relationships. The birth of a child, moving to another apartment. A spacious, beautiful house where the whole family can stay. If you want dad to spend more time with the children, then pick up pictures. Joint walks, classes, games. Everything that brings the family closer. This covers a very wide variety of topics: cooking, recreation, housing. 
Perhaps a new car that can accommodate the whole family,
 along with the animals.

Sector "Health" healthy eating, meditation, emotional health, physical health, financial health, spiritual health. sector "Creativity, children" You care about parenting, and you want them to grow up to be creative people, your hobbies. Sector "Career" meet internal desires or dreams, good relationships in the team.
 Sector "Travel" places where you dream to visit. So let's get started.

 Let's make our wish card correctly so that it will certainly work.
